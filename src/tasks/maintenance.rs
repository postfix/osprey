//! The low-priority loop: batched access times, disk eviction, and the write-ahead
//! log checkpoint.
//!
//! Everything here goes on the store's **maintenance** queue, which the store task
//! looks at only when nothing is waiting on the critical one (SPEC §10: "give pending
//! blocklist commits priority over ordinary queued cache maintenance"). Nothing here
//! is ever awaited by an HTTP handler, which is the other half of that sentence:
//! a request records a key and moves on, and this loop is what writes it.
//!
//! The order within a pass is deliberate. Access times are written first, so the
//! eviction that follows judges recency by what has just been read rather than by
//! what was read a pass ago. The checkpoint runs last, after whatever eviction wrote.
