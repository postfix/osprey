//! SPEC §8's reload procedure: change detection, a capped read, whole-candidate
//! validation off the request path, the revision and window rules, the commit, and
//! only then the atomic publish.
//!
//! The order at the end of [`poll_once`] is the load-bearing part. SPEC §10 says
//! "Persist a new blocklist before publishing its memory snapshot", so a commit that
//! fails must leave the previous snapshot in force — including the case where there
//! is no previous snapshot and the answer to every request stays `503`. Publishing
//! first would make a block enforceable that a restart would then silently forget.
